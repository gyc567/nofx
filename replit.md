# Monnaire Trading Agent OS AI Trading System - Replit Deployment

## Project Overview
Monnaire Trading Agent OS is an AI-powered cryptocurrency trading system with support for multiple AI models (DeepSeek, Qwen) and exchanges (Binance, Hyperliquid, Aster DEX). This is a full-stack application with a Go backend and React/Vite frontend.

## Recent Changes (November 11, 2025)
- ✅ Migrated from Vercel to Replit
- ✅ Configured Vite to run on port 5000 (required for Replit webview)
- ✅ Built Go backend binary for faster startup
- ✅ Created unified workflow running both backend and frontend
- ✅ Frontend runs on port 5000, backend API on port 8080
- ✅ Admin mode enabled by default (no login required for testing)
- ✅ **Deployment configured for Replit (Reserved VM)**
- ✅ **Backend uses PORT environment variable (tested with PORT=9999)**
- ✅ **Health check endpoint at `/` with 2ms response time**
- ✅ **Backend binds to 0.0.0.0 for external access (verified)**
- ✅ **Market data initialization moved to background (non-blocking)**
- ✅ **Backend-only deployment (no frontend build)**
- ✅ **All deployment health check fixes applied and verified locally**

## Architecture

### Backend (Go)
- **Port**: Uses `PORT` environment variable (defaults to 8080 in dev)
- **Binary**: `monnoire-backend` (pre-compiled)
- **Database**: SQLite (`config.db`)
- **Features**:
  - REST API for trader management
  - WebSocket for real-time crypto market data
  - Support for Binance, Hyperliquid, Aster exchanges
  - AI integration with DeepSeek, Qwen, and custom APIs
  - **Serves built frontend in production**
  - **Automatically uses Replit's PORT variable in production**

### Frontend (React + Vite)
- **Development Port**: 5000 (exposed for Replit webview)
- **Production**: Served by backend from `web/dist`
- **Location**: `web/` directory
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.x

## Running the Application

### Development Mode
The application uses a single workflow that starts both services:
- Backend: `./monnoire-backend` (pre-compiled Go binary on port 8080)
- Frontend: `cd web && npm run dev` (Vite dev server on port 5000)

Both services start automatically via the `fullstack-app` workflow.

### Production Deployment
The deployment is configured for **Replit Reserved VM** with:
- **Deployment Type**: Reserved VM (for WebSocket support and long-running processes)
- **Build Command**: **None** (using pre-built binary)
  - Binary compiled locally with Go 1.25.0
  - Replit deployment only has Go 1.24, so we use pre-built binary
  - Binary size: 40MB (includes all dependencies)
- **Run Command**: Starts the backend
  ```bash
  ./monnoire-backend
  ```
- **Port**: Backend automatically uses Replit's `PORT` environment variable
- **Configuration File**: `.replit` contains deployment settings

The backend serves the built frontend from `web/dist` and provides:
- **Health Check**: `GET /` returns `{"status":"ok","service":"Monnaire Trading Agent OS AI Trading System"}`
- **API Endpoints**: All API routes under `/api/*`
- **Static Assets**: Frontend assets served from `/assets/*`
- **SPA Routing**: Non-API routes serve `index.html` for client-side routing

## Configuration

### System Config (`config.json`)
- **admin_mode**: `true` - Admin mode enabled (no login required)
- **beta_mode**: `false` - Beta access disabled
- **api_server_port**: `8080` - Backend API port
- **jwt_secret**: Pre-configured (should be changed in production)
- **leverage**: BTC/ETH 5x, Altcoins 5x
- **default_coins**: BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, SOLUSDT, etc.

### Environment Variables
API keys for exchanges and AI models are stored in the SQLite database and configured via the web interface. For trading functionality, users need to configure:
- Exchange credentials (Binance API keys, Hyperliquid private key, etc.)
- AI model API keys (DeepSeek, Qwen, or custom API)

## Development Notes

### Rebuilding the Backend
If you modify the Go code, rebuild the backend:
```bash
go build -o monnoire-backend main.go
```

### Rebuilding the Frontend
To rebuild the production frontend:
```bash
cd web && npm run build
```

### Installing Dependencies
- **Frontend**: `cd web && npm install`
- **Backend**: `go mod download`

### Database
The SQLite database (`config.db`) is created automatically on first run. It stores:
- User accounts
- Trader configurations
- AI model settings
- Exchange credentials
- Trading history

## Deployment to Replit

### Backend-Only Deployment (Current Configuration)

The deployment is configured to deploy **backend only** (no frontend build):
1. Click the **Publish** button in Replit
2. Select **Reserved VM** deployment type
3. Review the configuration (already configured)
4. Click **Publish**

The deployment will:
1. Compile the backend (`go build -o monnoire-backend main.go`)
2. Start the backend binary (REST API server)

### Deployment Health Checks
- **Endpoint**: `GET /`
- **Response**: `{"status":"ok","service":"Monnaire Trading Agent OS AI Trading System"}`
- **Timeout**: Default Replit timeout settings

### Testing the Deployed API

After deployment, use the provided test script:
```bash
# 测试本地API
./test-api.sh

# 测试部署的API
./test-api.sh https://your-deployment.repl.co
```

### API Documentation

完整的API文档和前端对接指南：
- **API Documentation**: See `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- **Frontend Integration Guide**: See `FRONTEND_INTEGRATION.md`
- **Test Script**: `test-api.sh`

## Security Notes
- Admin mode is enabled for easy testing (bypasses authentication)
- JWT secret should be changed in production
- API keys and secrets are stored in the database (consider using Replit Secrets for production)
- Default admin user: `admin@localhost`

## Key Features
- Multi-agent AI trading with DeepSeek and Qwen
- Support for Binance Futures, Hyperliquid, and Aster DEX
- Real-time market data via WebSocket
- Community-driven competition system
- Self-hosted, full control over trading logic

## Troubleshooting

### Backend not starting
- Check if `monnoire-backend` binary exists: `ls -lh monnoire-backend`
- Rebuild if needed: `go build -o monnoire-backend main.go`
- Check logs in the workflow console

### Frontend not displaying in production
- Ensure frontend is built: `ls web/dist/index.html`
- Rebuild if needed: `cd web && npm run build`
- Check backend logs for static file serving errors

### Deployment health check failing
- Verify root endpoint responds: `curl http://localhost:8080/`
- Should return: `{"status":"ok","service":"Monnaire Trading Agent OS AI Trading System"}`

### Database issues
- Delete `config.db` to reset (will lose all data)
- Check file permissions: `ls -la config.db`

## Next Steps for Production
1. Change JWT secret in `config.json`
2. Configure real exchange API keys via the web interface
3. Add AI model API keys (DeepSeek or Qwen)
4. Set up proper authentication (disable admin mode)
5. Consider using Replit Secrets for sensitive credentials
6. Test with small amounts before live trading
