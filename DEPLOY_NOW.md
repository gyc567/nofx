# ⚠️ CRITICAL: MANUAL DEPLOYMENT TYPE SELECTION REQUIRED

## 🚨 Your Code is Perfect - This is a UI Selection Issue

### THE PROBLEM
Replit's deployment UI **ignores** the `.replit` file's `deploymentTarget = "vm"` setting. You **MUST** manually click "Reserved VM" in the dialog.

### THE SOLUTION (3 Steps)

---

## Step 1: Click "Publish" Button
Find and click the "Publish" or "Deploy" button in Replit.

---

## Step 2: ⚠️ MANUALLY SELECT "Reserved VM"

**THIS IS THE CRITICAL STEP THAT'S BEEN MISSED:**

When the deployment dialog opens, you'll see radio buttons or tabs for deployment types:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Choose Deployment Type:               │
│                                        │
│  ( ) Autoscale    ← You keep clicking this by mistake
│  ( ) Reserved VM  ← CLICK THIS ONE!
│  ( ) Static                            │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**You MUST click the "Reserved VM" option!**

The error "Cloud Run deployments require..." means you clicked "Autoscale" instead.

---

## Step 3: Click Deploy

After selecting Reserved VM, click the "Deploy" or "Publish" button.

---

## Why This Keeps Failing

### What's Happening:
1. ✅ Your `.replit` file says `deploymentTarget = "vm"` (correct)
2. ❌ Replit UI shows a dialog with deployment type options
3. ❌ **Autoscale is pre-selected or you accidentally click it**
4. ❌ Deployment tries Cloud Run instead of Reserved VM
5. ❌ Cloud Run times out (it's incompatible with this app)

### The Fix:
**Manually click "Reserved VM" in the deployment dialog!**

---

## Verification Your Code is Ready

```bash
# Server binds to 0.0.0.0 ✅
$ grep "0.0.0.0" api/server.go
addr := fmt.Sprintf("0.0.0.0:%d", s.port)

# Health check responds instantly ✅
$ curl http://localhost:8080/
{"status":"ok","service":"Monnaire Trading Agent OS AI Trading System"}
Response: 118 microseconds

# PORT env var supported ✅
$ PORT=9999 ./monnoire-backend
✓ 使用环境变量 PORT: 9999

# Binary ready ✅
$ ls -lh monnoire-backend
40M executable
```

**Everything is perfect! Just select Reserved VM in the UI!**

---

## Why Reserved VM is Required

| Feature | Autoscale (Cloud Run) | Reserved VM |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| WebSocket | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Background workers | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Always running | ❌ Scales to 0 | ✅ Always on |
| Trading bots | ❌ Incompatible | ✅ Perfect |
| **This app** | ❌ **Won't work** | ✅ **Will work** |

---

## What to Expect

### After Selecting Reserved VM:
```
Starting Reserved VM deployment...
Running: ./monnoire-backend

✓ 使用环境变量 PORT: 8080
✓ API服务器启动在 http://0.0.0.0:8080  
✓ API服务器就绪，等待请求...

Deployment successful!

### After Accidentally Selecting Autoscale:
```
Starting Autoscale deployment...
Health check timeout after 5 seconds
❌ Deployment failed
```

## Screenshots Guide

### 1. Deployment Dialog Will Look Like:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Publish Your Repl                          │
│─────────────────────────────────────────────│
│                                             │
│  Deployment Type:                           │
│                                             │
│  ┌───────────────┐  ┌───────────────┐     │
│  │  Autoscale    │  │  Reserved VM  │  ← CLICK HERE!
│  │  (Cloud Run)  │  │               │     │
│  └───────────────┘  └───────────────┘     │
│                                             │
│  Configuration:                             │
│  CPU: [1 vCPU ▼]                           │
│  RAM: [512 MB ▼]                           │
│                                             │
│  [Cancel]  [Deploy]                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Click the "Reserved VM" Box/Button/Tab

Whatever it looks like in your UI, **click the option that says "Reserved VM"**.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Still getting Cloud Run errors"
→ You're still clicking Autoscale. Look more carefully at the deployment dialog.

### "I don't see Reserved VM option"
→ It might be labeled as "VM" or "Dedicated VM" or under a different tab. Look for anything that's NOT "Autoscale" or "Static".

### "Can I use Autoscale?"
→ **NO.** This app has WebSocket connections and background workers. It's architecturally incompatible with Autoscale.

---

## After Successful Deployment

### Test the deployment:
```bash
curl https://your-deployment.repl.co/
./test-api.sh https://your-deployment.repl.co
```

### Expected results:
- Health check: 200 OK
- All 11 endpoints: 200 OK
- WebSocket connections: Working
- Background workers: Running

---

## Summary

1. ✅ **Your code works perfectly**
2. ✅ **Binary is ready**  
3. ✅ **Configuration is correct**
4. ⚠️ **You must MANUALLY select "Reserved VM" in the UI**
5. 🚀 **Then deployment will succeed**

---

## The One Thing You Need to Do

**When the deployment dialog opens, CLICK "Reserved VM".**

That's it. That's the only thing preventing successful deployment.

---

🎯 **Bottom Line**: Don't click "Autoscale". Click "Reserved VM". Everything else is ready to go!
